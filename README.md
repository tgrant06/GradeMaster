## Installation and Setup Guide

### For personal usage (Windows)

1. Install the Zip-File (GradeMaster_[win-x64/win-arm64].zip depending on your System architecture) from the Release Section. Make sure you install the newest available version.
2. Unpack the Zip-File in the `C:\Program Files\` directory.
3. After the installation you will see the folder containing the app. There you can copy the shortcut and paste it to the Desktop.
4. You can now launch the app from the shortcut.
5. Before you launch the application make sure you trust the binary, by checking the mark in the Properties tab when right clicking the file. <br/>
(File location: `C:\Program Files\GradeMaster\bin\win-x64\GradeMaster.DesktopClient.exe` <br/>
or `C:\Program Files\GradeMaster\bin\win-arm64\GradeMaster.DesktopClient.exe` for arm based systems)
6. Optional: If you like you can also copy the shortcut to the Start Menu. You can do this by copying the shortcut to this directory: `Win + R` then `%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs`.

### Updating Software (Windows)

1. Make sure you delete the `C:\Program Files\GradeMaster` directory. (It is recommended you make a backup of your Data by copying your GradeMaster.db file located in `C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Local\GradeMaster\Data`. The database should remain compatible with the newer versions of the app and no data should be lost)
2. Then follow the same steps from the Installation Guide for personal use. (You do not have to copy the shortcut again. You can skip this step. Only do this step if the shortcut doesn't work anymore.)

#### Disclaimer: [Updating from Version v1.x.x to v2.x.x or higher](Docs/Update_from_version_v1.x.x_to_v2.x.x.md)

### Uninstalling the App for Users (Windows)

1. Delete the directory `C:\Program Files\GradeMaster`.
2. You can also delete the application data directory if you want to delete your data (not recommended). To do this delete the directory `C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Local\GradeMaster`.
3. You can also delete all of the shortcuts. Delete them, where you copied them.

### For Development

2. Make sure you have the necessary stuff installed in Visual Studio for .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid applications.
3. Open the Solution located in: `..YourPath\GradeMaster\Src\GradeMaster.sln` in Visual Studio.
4. Let Visual Studio start up.
5. Then make sure all the packages and dependencies are loaded.
6. Next you can build the solution.
